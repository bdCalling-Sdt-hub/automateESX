Important Information

Thank you for trusting us with your insurance needs. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact your company claim
professional directly.

This estimate is prepared using generally prevailing prices of building materials and labor in your geographic location and
represents an estimate of damages recorded at the time of inspection. We encourage you to work with a contractor of your choice
to complete these repairs. Please present this estimate to your contractor. If you or your contractor has any questions, have them
contact us. Please notify us immediately if additional damage is identified, or if your contractor’s estimate exceeds this estimate.
A subsequent inspection of the property may be required to inspect damages not known or visible at the time of the first
inspection.

Please be advised that within your estimate we may have applied depreciation to the repairs and/or replacement to structural
and/or personal property items. Depreciation is based on the age and condition of the items, at the time of the loss, compared to
its expected useful life. During the claim process, we asked for your assistance in establishing the age and condition of your
damaged items. An item that has the expected wear and tear for its age and useful life will be considered in Average Condition.

If after review of your estimate, please feel free to contact your adjuster should you have any questions or concerns on the
depreciation that was applied. If we do not hear from you, we will conclude that you agree that the ages and conditions outlined
in the estimate are accurate.

If an amount is shown for Recoverable Depreciation, you may be entitled to this value or the amount you actually spend to repair
or replace the items, whichever is less, subject to your policy conditions. Following our payment of the Actual Cash Value
amount to you, please make repairs and/or replacement to the covered property, that was subject of the claim, as soon as
reasonably possible.

Please refer to your policy or settlement letter for details on any applicable time limits and documentation necessary for recovery
of withheld recoverable depreciation amounts. Please send any correspondence, photos, or supporting repair documentation to
your adjuster at claims @ngic.com or the regular mail address below. Please include the claim number on all documents. If you
are sending documents via email, please include the claim number in the subject line.

PO Box 1623
Winston-Salem, NC 27102-1623

If you wish, you may repair or replace with higher quality items, but we will only pay the recoverable depreciation as stated in
our estimate. If the repair or replacement cost to you is less than the estimated replacement cost, we will only pay the difference
between your cost less your deductible and the actual cash value already paid to you.

Your mortgage holder may be named on your payment. If your mortgagee is named on your payment you should contact them
directly to obtain instructions on their process for releasing funds for your claim. If there has been a change in the mortgage, or if
there is no longer a mortgage on the home, please contact us immediately to make those corrections. In addition to notifying us
of a change in your mortgage, you are required to notify your agent immediately.

This estimate report does not confirm the validity of coverage and does not constitute settlkement of your claim.
