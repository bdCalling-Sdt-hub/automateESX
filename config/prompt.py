rules:

- if you think any data is not available just enter N/A instead of that data except for the tax_jurisdiction you will use None in tax_jurisdiction in this case
- if you think any data is not relevant just enter N/A instead of that data except for the tax_jurisdiction you will use None in tax_jurisdiction in this case
- you must follow that structure
- do not send me any other message I don't need your opinion regardless if it is valualbe or not
